NConf README
============

**NConf is not dead.** It's just no longer developed by the original developer(s). Here is the most current NConf build updated for current software releases.

A. Requirements
---------------

NConf system requirements:
   TESTED with the following
    * Apache webserver 2.4.38
    * PHP 7.3, php-mysqli, php-ldap (only if using LDAP auth)
    * MariaDB 10.3.29 (with InnoDB)
    * Perl 5.28, perl-DBI, perl-DBD-MySQL
    * Nagios 4.4.6


php.ini settings:

    * short_open_tag = On
    * register_globals = Off
    * magic_quotes_gpc = Off 


Compatibility (older version):
NConf has been tested on Red Hat, Fedora and CentOS Linux.
It has not been tested on Windows or any UNIX, or with SELinux.


Security considerations:
NConf is intended to be deployed within a private network or intranet. As such, development focus is clearly not that of a secure Internet application. Although it can be run anywhere, we do not advise users to publish NConf as a public site.
